<p>There are several Reasons to watch this beautiful anime K-On ! and I listed some of my best personal reasons to watch this show</p>

## Fantastic Music and Songs

<p>Kyoto Animation doesnt play around when it comes to music and songs. And since it is a music centered anime they did a pretty amazing job all around. My favourite Song is the graduation Song that plays near the end of the show where I shed some tears Listening to it.</p>
